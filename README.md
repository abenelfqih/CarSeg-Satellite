# CarSeg-Satellite
Satellite car image segmentation using DeepLab for traffic analysis and urban planning applications.


## Overview
CarSeg-Satellite is a project focused on segmenting car images from satellite imagery using the DeepLab architecture. This work aims to facilitate traffic analysis, urban planning, and other applications requiring precise car localization from aerial views.

## Features
- Employs DeepLab for semantic segmentation of cars in satellite imagery.
- Optimized for high-resolution satellite images.
- Includes pre-processing steps to handle large-scale datasets.
- Visualizations for segmentation results and performance metrics.

## Applications
- **Traffic Analysis:** Monitor car density in urban areas.
- **Urban Planning:** Assist in designing infrastructure by analyzing car distributions.
- **Environment Studies:** Understand urbanization patterns through vehicle analysis.
